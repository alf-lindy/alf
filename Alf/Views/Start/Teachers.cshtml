<p><b>Nicolas Deniau</b></p>
<p>For Nicolas Deniau, dancing has been a big part of life since childhood. Starting with Rock'n Roll at the age of eight he did his first competition after only one year of dancing. Touring France for competitions Nicolas quickly got experienced within the entertainment aspect of dancing, during his performances you can feel his energy from the very back row. Nicolas later fell in love with swing dancing and in particular with Boogie Woogie. After several victories at the French Championships in Lindy Hop and Boogie Woogie he started to compete internationally. In Boogie Woogie Nicolas has been part of the international elite for many years, taking the fourth place at the International Championships in 2010.</p>
<p>In 2005 Nicolas formed the dance group "The Crazyers" together with William Mauvais, with which he has been touring and performing in all of Europe. He has also toured with the famous choreographer Charlie Moser and his troupe for the musical "Fashion ou l'infer d'Eurydice". To deepen his general dancing skills, Nicolas attended a dance education in jazz, ballet and contemporary dance in 2008.</p>
<p>In the last years Nicolas has focused a lot on his Lindy Hop, resulting in a 2nd place at the European Swing Dance Championships 2011. Today Nicolas travels all over the world to compete, perform and teach Lindy Hop and Boogie Woogie. When teaching, Nicolas radiates great energy and focuses completely on his students. With a smile on his face he shows you that even the trickiest things can be possible to learn</p>
